# Stardew Valley Clone

This is a desktop game, which is similar to the famous game "Stardew Valley".  
You play a farmer who needs to grow crops and expand their fields. You make money by selling your products, to improve your home or buy new crops or materials.  
There are a day-and-night cycle, different types of weather, different crops harvestable resources, and a merchant.  
Contrary to the original game, you don't have a mine with monsters and minerals, no village with NPCs, no fishing. This is a simplified game.
